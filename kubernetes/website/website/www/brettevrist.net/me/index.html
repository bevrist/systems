<h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
<p>

<h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
<p>
Brett Austin Evrist was born in 1681 on the planet Lvsr, where he was infected by the parasitic life form known as the Flood. The Flood gave him a task: find the Master Chief and take all his sprinkles. The Master Chief did not want to give up his sprinkles, and he shot Brett 67 times in the chest. Brett survived however, and saved the Candy Kingdom from the evil humans and eventually became the next Gravemind. When he once again met the Master Chief, he decided that now that he was in charge, he didnt want the Chief's sprinkles, and he decided to just have some tea and cookies with him instead. Brett later bacame the Governor of Alaska, going by his stage name: "Sarah Palin". In 1849 however, Brett's home planet came under attack. He resigned being the Governor and flew off on his magical unicorn.
<p>
<h2>LATER LIFE</h2>
<p>
Brett returned to Earth years later after the Midget Wars were over. He had lost his left arm in combat, but was able to grow a whip-like tentacle in its place due to his unique biology as a Gravemind. Later, a rebellion in the Flood ranks revolted against Brett and they killed him. He returned as a Zombie and began his conquest of eating all the baseball bats in City 17. He used his Portal Gun, and set off a chain reaction that resulted in the creation of the darkest creatures ever to walk the Earth: Conrad Murray. With the death of his best friend, Ivan the Terrible, Brett fell into a deep depression. He got addicted to morphine and somehow wound up in the 74th annual Hunger Games where he killed Woody Harrelson with a spoon and a black bandana. After the Games, Brett flew off to space to find a purpose for his life.

He picked up the perfect job as a greeter at the Intergalactic Walmart where he quickly rose up in the ranks. When he acquired the rank of Grand Master Shogun of Walmart, he was forced to resign for singing Justin Bieber songs in Isle 3 while restocking the shelves. Once again alone, he became a drifter and met people like Adam Sandler, who happened to also be drifting through space. His life changed forever when he met Morgan Freeman, who gifted him the superpower of Nuclear Spit after devouring 2 of Morgan Freeman's toes. With his miraculous abilities, he went back to the Flood ranks, where he once again became the Gravemind and went to confront his arch enemy: Gingivitis.

He invaded the city of Arlen, Texas where he killed Bruce Wayne but decided to let Batman live, because Brett liked the way he dressed. After a giant fight with Thor and Iron Man, Brett rode a 7-headed Hydra to the Sun, where he got an army made of fire people that killed Captain Jack Sparrow's evil twin, Alec Baldwin. Brett later allied himself with Scooby Doo to solve the mystery of who had been taking stop signs from the park. The answer would haunt Brett for the rest of his days.

The Master Chief had been taking the stop signs and used them to make lances to defend his fort made of mattresses in the gutter. Brett launched a full scale assault with an army of an incredible 3 soldiers and drove the Chief into his fort. However, The Master Chief used his almighty sprinkles that Brett had coveted for so long to open a portal to High Charity, the holy city of the Covenant. Grunts, Jackals, Elites, and Brutes charged down from the sky on purple elephants armed with flaming Mexican Food that would give you indigestion for weeks. Brett had a trick up his sleeve though, and summoned the almighty Rihanna who killed thousands of Covenant soldiers with her musical talent. But her arch rival, Beyonce, summoned the dark creature called The Situation, who attacked, resulting in World War VIII.

The Earth was ravaged by the many wars. Brett saw this and in an incredible act of heroism, used his Flood powers to spread his tentacles into all of the Earth, holding it together and slowly healing the planet. After elevendy billion years, the Earth was saved. Brett was a hero, but yet another Flood rebellion left him a shattered outcast again.
<p>
<h2>FINAL RISE TO POWER AND SECOND DEATH</h2>
<p>
Brett had finally decided that he had had enough. He charged back to Earth and annihilated the Flood, leaving him the only Flood form left in the Universe. He proclaimed himself ruler of the planet and destroyed all who got in the way. A group was formed in secret, know as The I.C.S.P.F.P.W.D.L.B. or the Ice Cream Social Party For People Who Don't Like Brett. They all got in a big group and whined their asses off until they were given guns by angry hobos. They swam through rivers of raw sewage to get to Brett's palace. They found that the sewage was mutagenic and radioactive and their organs were turned into liquid shit. However, they forged on and stormed the palace. Brett was too fat from eating corn dogs for 20 years, so he was helpless when they drove stop signs through his gonads, killing him instantly for the second time. This would not be the end however.
<p>
<h2>STILL OUT THERE</h2>
<p>
Brett's consciousness separated from his dead husk of a body and drifted aimlessly through the world. He was searching for an empty body for him to posses. After quite a while, he found one in the form of a massive nuclear-powered robot. He confronted the ancient and wise being known as Jeff Bridges, who told him the secrets of life and what Brett should do next. Brett understood his words and set out to fulfill his destiny.

He returned to his home planet of Lvsr and rallied his people. In the year 20,948,739,839, he and his forces took of on their majestic Tricorn steeds and entered Earth's orbit. The planet that Brett had saved and was briefly conqueror of meant nothing to him now. He and his forces raised their magic wands and destroyed the Earth with the power of friendship. With that finally out of the way, Brett went on to be the ruler of the nearest 7-11 convenient store, where he works to this very day.

<h2>PERSONALITY AND TRAITS</h2>
<p>
Brett had many powers in the multiple bodies he had over the years. In his Gravemind form, he had complete powers over his Flood offspring, had massive tentacles, and could bore you to death with his elegant yet unnecessary iambic pentameter whenever he spoke. When he became a Zombie, Brett had the new ability to moan and drag himself along with his tentacles. In his spirit form, Brett possessed telepathy and limited psychokinetic abilities. In his final robot form, Brett had cannons, shields, pixie dust, immense strength, and a horse hidden in his left wrist that could be deployed for reconnaissance missions.

Brett was known for his kind demeanor and his tolerant attitude towards religions and annoying little kids. However, Brett was broken after the 2nd Flood rebellion, after which he became insane and angry. His rage alone could now kill his enemies. Luckily though, when he inhabited his robot form, all of his emotions were neutralized.
